# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project, we have looked at data from 12 the stocks of 12 different green energy companiesto compare and determine which is best suited for Steve's investment. This analysis includes a look at the years 2018 and 2018, and includes both the total daily volume as well as the net return on each of these stocks for these years. With this info, Steve can make a more informed decision on his investment in green energy.

This analysis also covers re-factoring code. Re-factoring is a method of editing code to make it more efficient and faster. Code was written for this project, and then refactored in order to examine this method and determine its pros and cons.
